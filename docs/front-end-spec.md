## Executive Summary

### What This Spec Delivers

This specification enables a developer to build a professional, audit-ready web application for SMETA compliance documentation management. It balances comprehensiveness with speed, leveraging Material-UI to maximize development velocity.

**Key Features:**
- **Dashboard-driven navigation** - 6 large cards for intuitive pillar access
- **Fast document retrieval** - ≤10 seconds from request to display
- **Professional aesthetic** - Navy + green color scheme, clean Material Design
- **Drag-and-drop uploads** - Intuitive document management
- **CAPA tracking** - Corrective action lifecycle management
- **Global search** - Fast cross-pillar document discovery
- **100% offline** - No internet dependency during audit

**Success Metrics:**
- Document retrieval: ≤10 seconds (target: 2-5 seconds)
- Search results: ≤3 seconds
- Zero learning curve: 5 minutes to proficiency
- Professional impression: Impresses Sedex auditor
- Accessibility: WCAG AA compliant, keyboard navigable

## Design Decisions Summary

### Why Material-UI?

**Speed:** Pre-built accessible components save 40-60% development time  
**Quality:** Proven design system, WCAG AA compliant out-of-the-box  
**Professional:** Material Design widely recognized as trustworthy  
**Documentation:** Extensive docs enable fast implementation

### Why Desktop-First?

**Context:** Audit conducted exclusively on laptop (1366×768 minimum)  
**Priority:** Desktop optimization > Mobile support  
**Timeline:** 8-10 hours insufficient for full responsive optimization  
**Result:** Mobile functional but not optimized (acceptable trade-off)

### Why Modal Overlays?

**Speed:** Faster back navigation, maintains context  
**Context:** Prevents loss of scroll position during rapid document access  
**Familiarity:** Common pattern, low learning curve  
**Concern:** Some users may find modals claustrophobic (mitigated by 90% viewport size)

### Why Navy + Green?

**Navy (#1a365d):** Trust, professionalism, corporate seriousness  
**Green (#38a169):** Compliance, approval, success, environmental consciousness  
**Contrast:** Both colors meet WCAG AA standards on white  
**Differentiation:** Green accent distinguishes from primary navy

## Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Hours 1-2)
✅ Project setup (Vite + React + MUI)  
✅ Theme configuration (colors, typography)  
✅ AppBar component  
✅ Dashboard with 6 navigation cards  

### Phase 2: Core Features (Hours 3-5)
✅ Upload modal (drag-and-drop)  
✅ Pillar view (breadcrumbs, tabs, document list)  
✅ Document viewer modal (PDF rendering)  

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features (Hours 6-7)
✅ Search functionality (bar in AppBar, results page)  
✅ CAPA tracker (list + details + form)  

### Phase 4: Polish (Hours 8-9)
✅ Loading states (skeletons)  
✅ Empty states  
✅ Error handling  
✅ Confirmation dialogs  
✅ Final testing

   - Verify appear in correct categories
   - Check document counts update

2. **Retrieval Test**
   - Navigate: Dashboard → Pillar 2 → Evidence
   - Click View on document
   - Verify PDF loads in <5 seconds
   - Close modal, verify returns to correct position

3. **Search Test**
   - Search "fire drill"
   - Verify results appear
   - Click result, verify opens correct document

4. **CAPA Test**
   - Open CAPA Tracker
   - Create new CAPA
   - Verify appears in list
   - Click to view details

5. **Keyboard Test**
   - Unplug mouse
   - Tab through dashboard
   - Navigate to document and open with Enter
   - Close with ESC

### Resolution Test (5 minutes)

- Set browser to 1366×768

- Use `sx` prop for styling (avoid separate CSS files)
- Test frequently during development (don't wait until the end)
- Prioritize working features over perfect design
- Refer to Implementation Guide for build order

**The specification balances comprehensiveness with practicality for overnight development. Good luck!**
