## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Development Risks (Immediate)

**RISK 1: Not Enough Time to Complete Development**
- **Probability:** HIGH
- **Impact:** CRITICAL
- **Mitigation:** 
  - **URGENT**: Hire experienced full-stack developer NOW (React + Node.js)
  - Pay premium for immediate availability (tonight)
  - Focus on MVP features only (cut non-essential)
  - Have backup: Well-organized folders + simple HTML index page
  - Parallel work: Developer builds while you organize documents

**RISK 2: Developer Availability**
- **Probability:** High
- **Impact:** Critical
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use Upwork/Fiverr/Freelancer for emergency hire
  - Look for developers in time zones that are daytime now
  - Offer bonus for overnight completion
  - Have 2-3 developer options lined up
  - Consider hiring development agency with on-call team

**RISK 3: Technical Issues During Development**
- **Probability:** Medium-High
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Use proven, simple tech stack (avoid experimental)
  - Extensive testing before audit
  - Keep it simple (don't over-engineer)
  - Have fallback: Static file server + organized folders
  - Developer must test on Windows environment

**RISK 4: Application Crashes During Audit**
- **Probability:** Low-Medium
- **Impact:** Critical
- **Mitigation:**
  - Thorough testing tonight (stress test)
  - Error handling and fallbacks in code
  - Keep servers running (don't restart during audit)
  - Have printed document index as backup
  - USB backup of entire application
  - Know how to restart quickly if needed

**RISK 5: File Upload Failures**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test with large files (>10MB)
  - Implement upload progress indicator
  - Allow resume/retry on failure
  - Have alternative: Manually copy files to uploads folder
  - Verify file integrity after upload

**RISK 6: Browser Compatibility Issues**
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test on Chrome (primary) and Edge (backup)
  - Use standard web technologies (avoid cutting-edge features)
  - Install both browsers on audit laptop
  - PDF viewer must work in both browsers

**RISK 7: Database Corruption**
- **Probability:** Low
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - Regular backups during development
  - SQLite is reliable and simple
  - Keep backup database file
  - Can rebuild database from uploaded files if needed

**RISK 8: Budget Overruns (Emergency Developer)**
- **Probability:** Medium
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Set fixed price upfront ($500-1500 for overnight work)
  - Define scope clearly (MVP only)
  - Time-box development (8-10 hours max)
  - If over budget, fall back to simpler solution
