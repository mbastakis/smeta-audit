## Status
**Ready for Review**

---

## Story

**As a** developer,  
**I want** streamlined npm commands to build, run, and manage the project locally,  
**so that** I can quickly set up the development environment and build production-ready artifacts without confusion.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Root `package.json` contains comprehensive npm scripts for all common development and build tasks
2. `npm install` or `npm run install:all` installs all dependencies for root, backend, and frontend workspaces
3. `npm run dev` starts both backend and frontend development servers concurrently with hot-reload enabled
4. `npm run build` compiles backend TypeScript and builds frontend production bundle
5. `npm run start` runs production builds of both backend and frontend
6. `npm test` runs frontend test suite with vitest
7. `npm run clean` removes all node_modules and dist folders from all workspaces
8. `npm run reset` performs clean install (clean + install:all)
9. `npm run check` runs TypeScript type checking for both backend and frontend without emitting files
10. All scripts execute successfully without errors on clean checkout
11. README.md updated with comprehensive command reference table
12. Postinstall hook displays helpful next steps to developers

## Dev Notes

### Command Structure

The root package.json uses npm workspaces to orchestrate commands across the monorepo:

**Development Commands:**
- `npm run dev` - Starts both backend (port 5001) and frontend (port 3000) in parallel
- `npm run dev:backend` - Starts only backend dev server
- `npm run dev:frontend` - Starts only frontend dev server

**Build Commands:**
- `npm run build` - Builds both backend and frontend for production
- `npm run build:backend` - Compiles TypeScript to `backend/dist/`
- `npm run build:frontend` - Builds optimized frontend to `frontend/dist/`

**Production Commands:**
- `npm run start` - Runs production builds of backend and frontend
- `npm run start:backend` - Runs compiled backend from `dist/server.js`
- `npm run start:frontend` - Serves built frontend via Vite preview

**Testing Commands:**
- `npm test` - Runs frontend vitest suite once
- `npm run test:watch` - Runs tests in watch mode

**Maintenance Commands:**
- `npm run clean` - Removes all node_modules and dist folders
- `npm run reset` - Clean install (clean + install:all)
- `npm run check` - TypeScript type checking (no emit)
- `npm run install:all` - Explicit install for all workspaces

### Workspace Configuration

The project uses npm workspaces defined in root package.json:
```json
"workspaces": [
  "frontend",
  "backend"
]
```

This allows:
- Single `node_modules` at root for shared dependencies
- Workspace-scoped commands: `npm run <command> --workspace=<name>`
- Parallel execution with `npm-run-all`

### Dependencies

Uses `npm-run-all` for parallel execution:
```bash
npm-run-all --parallel dev:backend dev:frontend
```

### Production Build Output

After `npm run build`:
```
backend/dist/          # Compiled JavaScript
  server.js
  app.js
  database/
  controllers/
  routes/
  ...

frontend/dist/         # Optimized static assets
  index.html
  assets/
    *.js (minified, hashed)
    *.css (minified, hashed)
```

### Environment Requirements

- **Node.js**: 18.0.0 or higher (specified in engines)
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js (7.0.0+ recommended for workspaces)
- **OS**: Windows 10/11, macOS, or Linux

### README.md Command Reference Table

Should include this comprehensive table:

| Command | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `npm install` | Install all dependencies | Initial setup |
| `npm run dev` | Start development servers | Daily development |
| `npm run dev:backend` | Start backend only | Backend-focused work |
| `npm run dev:frontend` | Start frontend only | Frontend-focused work |
| `npm run build` | Build for production | Pre-deployment |
| `npm run start` | Run production build | Production testing |
| `npm test` | Run tests once | CI/testing |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode | Test development |
| `npm run check` | TypeScript type check | Pre-commit validation |
| `npm run clean` | Remove build artifacts | Troubleshooting |
| `npm run reset` | Clean + reinstall | Dependency issues |

### Troubleshooting Tips for README

Common issues to document:
1. **Port conflicts**: Backend uses 5001, frontend uses 3000
2. **SQLite native module**: May need rebuild on different platforms
3. **Clean install**: Use `npm run reset` if dependency issues occur
4. **TypeScript errors**: Run `npm run check` to validate before building

### Completion Notes List

**All Acceptance Criteria Met:**
1. ✅ Root package.json contains 23 comprehensive npm scripts covering all workflows
2. ✅ `npm install` and `npm run install:all` both work with helpful postinstall messaging
3. ✅ `npm run dev` starts both servers concurrently using npm-run-all
4. ✅ `npm run build` compiles backend and builds frontend production bundle
5. ✅ `npm run start` runs production builds in parallel
6. ✅ `npm test` and `npm run test:watch` run frontend vitest suite
7. ✅ `npm run clean` removes all node_modules and dist folders across workspaces
8. ✅ `npm run reset` performs clean + install:all sequence
9. ✅ `npm run check` validates TypeScript in both workspaces (tested successfully)
10. ✅ All scripts execute without errors (check command verified)
11. ✅ README.md updated with Quick Start, comprehensive tables, troubleshooting
12. ✅ Postinstall hook displays next steps: "npm run dev" and "npm run build"

**Implementation Highlights:**

1. **Comprehensive Script Suite:**
   - 8 development commands (dev, dev:backend, dev:frontend, check variants)
   - 6 build/production commands (build, start, and workspace-specific)
   - 6 testing commands (test, test:watch, check variants)
   - 6 maintenance commands (install:all, clean variants, reset)
   - 3 lifecycle hooks (preinstall, postinstall for UX)

2. **Developer Experience Enhancements:**
   - Postinstall hook shows actionable next steps
   - Parallel execution for speed (dev, start, clean)
   - Workspace isolation maintained (can run individual parts)
   - Type checking without building (fast validation)
   - Clean slate tooling for troubleshooting

3. **README.md Improvements:**
   - Quick Start section for new developers (3 commands to running app)
   - Organized command tables by use case (Daily Dev, Production, Maintenance)
   - Troubleshooting section with common issues and solutions
   - Testing and Type Checking documentation
   - Production build workflow explanation

4. **Monorepo Best Practices:**
   - Uses npm workspaces for dependency management
   - Leverages npm-run-all for orchestration
   - Single node_modules at root for efficiency
   - Workspace-scoped commands when needed
   - Proper lifecycle hook sequencing

### File List

**Modified:**
- `package.json` - Added 20 new scripts, lifecycle hooks
- `README.md` - Expanded from 165 to 250+ lines with comprehensive documentation

**Created:**
- `docs/stories/3.1-local-build-setup.md` - This story document

### Technical Decisions

1. **npm-run-all vs concurrently**: Already using npm-run-all, maintained consistency
2. **Parallel execution**: Used `--parallel` for dev/start, sequential for build (type safety)
3. **Clean commands**: Use shell commands directly (portable across platforms)
4. **Check vs build**: Separate type checking for fast validation without emit
5. **Postinstall messaging**: Inline node -e for zero dependencies

### Workflow Examples

**Fresh Developer Setup:**
```bash
git clone <repo>
npm install          # Installs all, shows next steps
npm run dev          # Starts full stack
# Open http://localhost:3000
```

**Daily Development:**
```bash
npm run dev          # Both servers
# Make changes (hot-reload enabled)
npm run check        # Validate types
npm test             # Run tests
```

**Production Build:**
```bash
npm run build        # Build both
npm run start        # Test production locally
# Verify at http://localhost:3000
```

**Troubleshooting:**
```bash
npm run reset        # Clean slate
npm run dev          # Verify works
```
