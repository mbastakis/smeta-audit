# Story 2.9: Frontend Specification Alignment

## Status
**Draft**

## Story
**As a** UX designer,  
**I want** the frontend implementation to match the design specification,  
**so that** the application provides a consistent, professional user experience that meets WCAG AA standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Dashboard Improvements
1. Dashboard cards display icons in **accent green** (#38a169), not inside colored circles
2. Card icons are **48px size**, centered above the title
3. Document count badge appears as a **Chip component** (small size) below subtitle, not as a MUI Badge
4. Card layout: Icon (top center) → Title → Subtitle → Count Chip (all centered)
5. Hero section subtitle uses **body1** typography, not h6

### AppBar Improvements
6. AppBar displays "**SMETA Compliance Platform**" as title (not "SMETA Platform")
7. Search bar width is **400px** (not flexGrow with maxWidth: 600)
8. Search bar has **24px border-radius** (pill shape), not default 4px
9. Upload button text is "**Upload**" (not "Upload Document")

### Theme Improvements
10. Theme includes all semantic colors: success, error, warning, info with proper hex codes
11. Theme includes secondary color as slate gray (#2d3748), not green
12. Typography scale includes h3, h4, h5, h6 with proper font weights (see spec)
13. Theme spacing uses 8px base unit
14. Theme shape borderRadius set to 8px

### Component Consistency
15. All buttons use proper variants: contained (primary), outlined (secondary), text (tertiary)
16. Status chips in CAPA use proper color coding per spec
17. Breadcrumbs use NavigateNextIcon separator (not default)
18. Loading states use Skeleton components consistently

- Current: Badge component for counts
- Spec: Chip component (small size)
- Current: Hero subtitle is h6
- Spec: Hero subtitle is body1

**AppBar:**
