# Story 2.7: UI Polish & Final Testing

## Status
**Ready for Review**

## Story
**As an** HR manager,  
**I want** a polished, professional user interface with loading states and error handling,  
**so that** the application looks impressive and handles edge cases gracefully during the audit.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All buttons have consistent styling (Material-UI primary/secondary variants), proper spacing, and icons
2. All pages have consistent header styling, breadcrumb navigation, and spacing
3. Loading states implemented on all data-fetching operations: Dashboard counts, Document lists, Search results, CAPA list (skeleton screens or spinners)
4. Error states implemented: Failed API calls show user-friendly error messages with retry options
5. Empty states implemented: All lists show helpful messages when empty (e.g., "No documents uploaded yet. Click Upload to get started.")
6. Success/error snackbar notifications are consistent across all operations (green for success, red for error, auto-dismiss after 5 seconds)
7. Responsive layout tested and working on laptop resolutions: 1366×768, 1920×1080
8. Keyboard navigation tested: Tab order logical, Enter triggers buttons, Escape closes modals
9. File type icons consistent and recognizable (PDF red, DOCX blue, XLSX green, images purple)
10. Final walkthrough test passed: Complete audit scenario (upload 10 documents, search, view, manage CAPA) executed without errors
