# Story 2.2: Global Search UI with Results Page

## Status
**Ready for Review**

## Story
**As an** HR manager,  
**I want** to search for documents by name from any page,  
**so that** I can quickly find specific documents when the auditor requests them.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Search bar in top AppBar is functional with text input field and search icon button
2. User types search term and presses Enter or clicks search icon â†’ navigates to `/search?q={term}` route
3. Search results page displays search term at top: "Search results for: '{term}'"
4. Results displayed as Material-UI Cards grouped by pillar (collapsible sections)
5. Each result card shows: File type icon, Document name (highlighted matching text), Path breadcrumb (Pillar > Category), Upload date
6. Click on result card opens document viewer (reuses Story 1.7 viewer modal)
7. No results found: Display message "No documents found for '{term}'" with "Try different search term" suggestion
8. Search results page includes "Back to Dashboard" button
9. Loading state: Shows skeleton cards while search API call in progress
10. Search bar shows loading spinner during search, disabled during API call to prevent multiple requests
