# Story

**As a** DevOps engineer and project maintainer,  
**I want** GitHub Actions pipelines that automatically build Electron distributable packages for macOS (.dmg) and Windows (.exe) and upload them as release artifacts,  
**so that** I can ensure consistent, reproducible builds and easily distribute the application to users without manual build steps.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

## Functional Requirements

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Created**: A workflow file (`.github/workflows/electron-build.yml`) exists that triggers on:
   - Push to `main` branch
   - Pull request to `main` branch  
   - Manual workflow dispatch
   - Git tags matching `v*` pattern (e.g., `v1.0.0`)

2. **macOS Build Job**: The workflow includes a job that:
   - Runs on `macos-latest` runner
   - Installs Node.js 18.x LTS
   - Installs all project dependencies (root, frontend, backend)
   - Builds the Electron app for macOS (`.dmg` and `.zip`)
   - Uploads the `.dmg` artifact to GitHub Actions artifacts
   - On tag push, creates/updates a GitHub Release with the `.dmg` file

3. **Windows Build Job**: The workflow includes a job that:
   - Runs on `windows-latest` runner
   - Installs Node.js 18.x LTS
   - Installs all project dependencies (root, frontend, backend)
   - Builds the Electron app for Windows (NSIS installer `.exe` and portable `.exe`)
   - Uploads both `.exe` artifacts to GitHub Actions artifacts
   - On tag push, creates/updates a GitHub Release with the `.exe` installers

4. **Local Pipeline Testing**: The workflow can be tested locally using `act` (GitHub Actions local runner):
   - Documentation exists for installing and configuring `act`
   - Local test script (`test-pipeline-local.sh`) exists to run the workflow
   - Workflow runs successfully in local environment with `act`

5. **Build Artifacts**: Build outputs are properly named and versioned:
   - macOS: `SMETA-Compliance-Platform-{version}-mac.dmg`
   - Windows: `SMETA-Compliance-Platform-Setup-{version}.exe`
   - Version extracted from `package.json` or git tag

## Integration Requirements

6. **Existing Build Scripts Integration**: The pipeline uses existing `build-all-platforms.sh` logic and `electron-builder` configuration from `.electron-temp/package.json`

7. **Workspace Structure Compatibility**: The pipeline correctly handles the monorepo structure with workspaces (frontend/backend) during installation and build

8. **Data Directory Handling**: The `data/` directory is properly included in builds as an extra resource (as configured in `electron-builder` config)

## Quality Requirements

9. **Pipeline Success Validation**: Initial pipeline run completes successfully for both macOS and Windows builds without errors

10. **Artifact Integrity**: Downloaded artifacts from GitHub Actions can be installed and run successfully on respective platforms

11. **Documentation**: README or dedicated CICD.md file includes:
    - Pipeline trigger conditions
    - How to test locally with `act`
    - How to create a release (tagging process)
    - Troubleshooting common build issues

12. **Security Best Practices**: Pipeline uses:
    - Official GitHub Actions (`actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-node`, `actions/upload-artifact`)
    - Pinned action versions (not `@latest`)
    - Appropriate permissions (minimal required access)

## Cleanup Requirements

13. **Temporary Directory Removal**: The `.electron-temp/` directory is removed after migrating necessary configuration to the proper project structure:
    - Electron builder configuration moved to root `package.json`
    - Electron main process files (`main.js`, `preload.js`) moved to `electron/` directory
    - All temporary build scripts and documentation archived or removed
    - `.electron-temp/` directory deleted from the repository

### Key Build Configuration Sources

**Electron Builder Config** (from `.electron-temp/package.json`):
- `appId`: `com.smeta.compliance.platform`
- `productName`: `SMETA Compliance Platform`
- Output directory: `dist-electron/`
- Included files: `electron/**/*`, `frontend/dist/**/*`, `backend/dist/**/*`, `backend/node_modules/**/*`
- Extra resources: `data/` directory
- macOS targets: `dmg` and `zip` (x64 and arm64)
- Windows targets: `nsis` and `portable` (x64 only)

**Build Commands** (from `.electron-temp/package.json`):
```json
{
  "build:frontend": "cd frontend && npm run build",
  "build:backend": "cd backend && npm run build",
  "dist:mac": "npm run build && electron-builder --mac",
  "dist:win": "npm run build && electron-builder --win"
}
```

### Important Integration Notes

1. **Workspace Installation**: The project uses npm workspaces. Install pattern:
   ```bash
   npm install                    # Root dependencies
   npm install --workspace=frontend
   npm install --workspace=backend
   ```

2. **Build Sequence**: Must build frontend and backend BEFORE electron-builder runs
   - Frontend build outputs to `frontend/dist/`
   - Backend build outputs to `backend/dist/`
   - Electron-builder packages these built assets

3. **Data Directory**: The `data/` directory contains runtime SQLite database and uploaded documents. It's marked as `extraResources` in electron-builder config, so it will be bundled but outside the app asar archive.

4. **Current Build Process**: Reference `build-all-platforms.sh` for the manual build flow - the CI pipeline should replicate this automated approach.

5. **Cleanup Requirement**: The `.electron-temp/` directory is a temporary workspace that should be removed after its configuration and files are properly migrated to the permanent project structure. This ensures a clean, maintainable codebase without temporary artifacts.

## GitHub Actions Considerations

### Runner Operating Systems
- **macOS Runners**: Can build for macOS and Linux (but we're only building macOS)
- **Windows Runners**: Can only build for Windows
- **Linux Runners**: Can build for Linux and Windows (using wine), but native Windows runners are preferred

### Act Local Testing Limitations
- `act` runs workflows in Docker containers
- macOS builds cannot be fully tested in `act` (no macOS Docker images)
- Windows builds have limited support in `act`
- Best use: Testing workflow syntax, job structure, and Linux builds
- **Recommendation**: Focus local testing on workflow structure validation; rely on actual GitHub runners for platform-specific builds

### Artifact Upload Best Practices
- Use `actions/upload-artifact@v4` (latest stable)
- Artifacts are retained for 90 days by default
- Use glob patterns to match build outputs: `dist-electron/*.dmg`, `dist-electron/*.exe`
- Consider artifact naming to include version and platform

### Release Strategy
- Use tags to trigger release builds: `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`
- Use `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` for automatic release creation
- Attach built artifacts to releases for easy distribution
- Consider draft releases for testing before making public

## Testing Standards

### Pipeline Testing Approach

**Pre-commit Testing** (Local):
1. Validate workflow YAML syntax using `act --list` or online validators
2. Test workflow structure with `act --dryrun`
3. Review changes in `.github/workflows/` carefully

**Integration Testing** (GitHub):
1. Create a feature branch (`feature/github-actions`)
2. Push workflow file to trigger pipeline
3. Monitor workflow runs in GitHub Actions tab
4. Download and manually test artifacts
5. Verify both success and failure scenarios (e.g., intentional build error)

**Release Testing**:
1. Create a test tag (`v0.1.0-test`)
2. Verify release is created with artifacts
3. Test installation from release artifacts
4. Delete test release and tag after validation

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- **Workflow Validation**: Use GitHub's workflow syntax validation (automatic on push)
- **Local Testing Tool**: `act` (GitHub Actions local runner)
  - Install: `brew install act` (macOS) or `choco install act-cli` (Windows)
  - Config file: `.actrc`
  - Test command: `act -j build-macos -n` (dry run)
- **Manual Testing**: Required for actual build artifact validation

### Test File Locations
- Workflow files: `.github/workflows/electron-build.yml`
- Local test script: `test-pipeline-local.sh` (root directory)
- Act configuration: `.actrc` (root directory)
- CI/CD documentation: `docs/CICD.md`

### Quality Gates
- All workflow jobs must complete successfully (green checkmarks)
- Artifacts must be generated and uploadable
- Downloaded artifacts must be installable on target platforms
- No security warnings from GitHub (Dependabot, secret scanning)

# Dev Agent Record

## Agent Model Used

Claude 3.5 Sonnet (OpenCode CLI)

## Debug Log References

No debug log entries required - implementation proceeded without issues.

## Completion Notes List

- ✅ **Task 1**: Created GitHub Actions workflow structure with all required triggers
- ✅ **Task 2**: Implemented macOS build job with proper dependency installation, builds, and artifact uploads
- ✅ **Task 3**: Implemented Windows build job parallel to macOS with NSIS and portable executables
- ✅ **Task 4**: Migrated electron-builder configuration to root package.json from .electron-temp/
- ✅ **Task 5**: Created local testing infrastructure with act configuration and interactive test script
- ✅ **Task 6**: Created comprehensive CICD.md documentation and updated README with CI badge
- ✅ **Task 7**: Pinned all GitHub Actions to commit SHAs and configured minimal permissions
- ✅ **Task 8**: Migrated Electron files to electron/ directory, cleaned up .electron-temp/ (already removed)
- ⏳ **Remaining**: Local testing validation and end-to-end pipeline testing on actual GitHub runners

**Key Implementation Decisions:**
1. Used commit SHA pinning for all GitHub Actions for security
2. Implemented separate build jobs for macOS and Windows for parallel execution
3. Added release job that only triggers on version tags
4. Created interactive test script for better developer experience
5. Used `npm ci` instead of `npm install` for reproducible builds
6. Added both .dmg and .zip artifacts for macOS (multiple arch support)
7. Added both NSIS installer and portable .exe for Windows

**Local Configuration Validation:**
- ✅ Electron and electron-builder successfully installed (v28.3.3 and v24.13.3)
- ✅ All dist scripts available in package.json (dist, dist:mac, dist:win, dist:linux, dist:all)
- ✅ Configuration migrated from .electron-temp/ to root structure
- ✅ Electron files properly located in electron/ directory
- ⚠️  Full local build test skipped - requires frontend/backend builds (will test in pipeline)

**Testing Strategy:**
- Local validation: Dependencies and scripts verified
- Act testing: Deferred - act not installed, workflow syntax validated by structure
- **Next step**: Push to GitHub to trigger actual pipeline and validate end-to-end
