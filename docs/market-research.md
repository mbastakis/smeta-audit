### Target Segment Profile: The Sedex SMETA Auditor

**Description:**
Professional auditors certified by Sedex to conduct SMETA assessments. They are typically experienced in social compliance, occupational health & safety, and environmental standards. They work independently or for audit firms (like SGS, Bureau Veritas, Intertek, QIMA).

**Key Characteristics:**

**Professional Background:**
- 5-15 years in social compliance, labor rights, or H&S
- Often former factory managers, safety officers, or HR professionals
- Multi-lingual capabilities common
- Travel 60-80% of the time conducting audits

**Audit Workload:**
- Conduct 50-100+ audits per year
- Each audit: 1-3 days on-site
- Extensive report writing (6-10 hours per audit)
- Tight schedules, back-to-back audits common

**Audit Process:**
- **Pre-audit:** Review company documentation submitted in advance
- **On-site:** Opening meeting → Document review → Site walkthrough → Worker interviews → Closing meeting
- **Post-audit:** Report writing, evidence verification, CAPA recommendations

### Needs & Pain Points

**1. Time Pressure** - "I have 8 hours to assess compliance across 4 complex pillars"
- Need to find evidence quickly

## Auditor Psychology: What Actually Impresses Inspectors

### Tier 1: Game-Changing Impressions 🌟

#### 1. Instant Document Retrieval
- **Why it matters:** Most companies fumble, searching through filing cabinets or USB drives
- **Psychological impact:** "These people are prepared and professional"
- **Platform advantage:** Click → Open in 2 seconds vs. 5-10 minute searches
- **Auditor quote:** "When I ask for the 2024 fire drill records and they pull it up in 10 seconds, I know this audit will go smoothly"

#### 2. Visual Evidence Integration
- **Why it matters:** Photos/videos are harder to fake than documents
- **Psychological impact:** "This company has nothing to hide"
- **Platform advantage:** Evidence folder with timestamped photos, videos
- **Example:** Fire extinguisher maintenance records WITH photos of each extinguisher inspection

#### 3. Cross-Pillar Consistency
- **Why it matters:** Auditors check if policies match procedures match actual practices
- **Psychological impact:** "This is a mature compliance system, not audit theater"
- **Platform advantage:** Consistent file structure enforces discipline
- **Red flag avoided:** Contradictory information across pillars

### Tier 2: Strong Positive Impressions ⭐

#### 4. Clear CAPA Tracking
- **Why it matters:** Previous audit findings and how you addressed them
- **Psychological impact:** "They take compliance seriously and close loops"
- **Platform advantage:** Dedicated CAPA section with closure evidence
- **Auditor expectation:** See issue → See action taken → See verification

#### 5. KPI Dashboard at a Glance
- **Why it matters:** Shows you measure what matters
- **Psychological impact:** "Data-driven culture, not just compliance box-checking"
- **Platform advantage:** Visual dashboard on landing screen
- **Key metrics:** Accident rates, training completion, audit findings trends

#### 6. Professional Presentation Aesthetics
- **Why it matters:** First impression in opening meeting
- **Psychological impact:** "This is a modern, well-managed company"
- **Platform advantage:** Clean UI vs. messy file explorer
- **Caveat:** Don't overdo it - auditors are skeptical of "too polished"

### Tier 3: Subtle Credibility Builders ✓

#### 7. Authentic Imperfection
- **Why it matters:** Perfect documentation looks fake
- **Psychological impact:** "This is real, not sanitized for audit"
- **Balance needed:** Organized but with minor cross-outs, handwritten notes, real dates
- **Example:** Training roster with actual signatures, not printed names

#### 8. Quick Pivot to Related Documents
- **Why it matters:** Auditors often ask follow-up questions
- **Psychological impact:** "They know their own system"
- **Platform advantage:** Related documents linked or in same folder
- **Scenario:** "You mentioned fire safety training - show me the curriculum" → Click

#### 9. Backup/Redundancy Mindset
- **Why it matters:** Technology can fail
- **Psychological impact:** "They're prepared for contingencies"
- **Platform advantage:** Local files = No internet needed, but have USB backup
- **Pro tip:** "We also have printed indexes in case of tech issues"

### What DOESN'T Impress (Avoid These)

❌ **Over-automation** - "This all looks generated by software, where's the human element?"  
❌ **Excessive jargon** - "They're hiding behind buzzwords"  
❌ **Too much documentation** - "They're burying me in paper to avoid scrutiny"  
❌ **Defensive posture** - "Why are they so protective of these documents?"  
❌ **Technology showboating** - "I don't care about your fancy app, show me your safety records"

### The "Wow" Moment Formula

```
WOW = (Speed of Retrieval × Evidence Quality) + (Organization × Transparency) - (Complexity Friction)
```

**Platform's Wow Targets:**
1. **Opening meeting:** Show platform structure in 3 minutes → "This is impressive"
2. **First document request:** Sub-10-second retrieval → "These people are ready"
3. **Evidence depth check:** Click PDF → See procedure → See filled form → See photo evidence → "This is thorough"
4. **CAPA review:** Show closed-loop from finding to resolution → "They actually fix things"

## CAPA Framework Best Practices

### Understanding CAPA in SMETA Context

**CAPA = Corrective and Preventive Action**

This is arguably the MOST IMPORTANT section because:
1. Auditors heavily weight how you handle previous findings
2. Demonstrates continuous improvement culture
3. Shows accountability and systematic problem-solving

### CAPA Lifecycle in SMETA Audits

```
Finding Identified → Root Cause Analysis → Corrective Action Plan → Implementation → Verification → Closure
```

#### Stage 1: Finding Identification
- **Source:** Previous SMETA audit, internal audit, customer audit, incident investigation
- **Documentation needed:**
  - Original finding description
  - Date identified
  - Pillar/criteria reference
  - Severity level (Critical, Major, Minor, Observation)

#### Stage 2: Root Cause Analysis
- **Methods:** 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram, Fault Tree Analysis
- **Documentation needed:**
  - Investigation report
  - Root cause statement
  - Contributing factors

#### Stage 3: Corrective Action Plan
- **Elements:**
  - Immediate containment action (stop the bleeding)
  - Long-term corrective action (fix root cause)
  - Preventive action (prevent recurrence)
  - Responsible person
  - Target completion date
- **Documentation needed:**
  - CAPA form with all elements
  - Resource allocation approval
  - Timeline with milestones

#### Stage 4: Implementation
- **Activities:** Execute action plan
- **Documentation needed:**
  - Progress updates
  - Evidence of actions taken (photos, updated procedures, training records)
  - Interim reports

#### Stage 5: Verification
- **Activities:** Confirm effectiveness of actions
- **Documentation needed:**
  - Verification method (re-audit, monitoring data, observation)
  - Verification results
  - Auditor or manager sign-off

#### Stage 6: Closure
- **Criteria:** Root cause eliminated, no recurrence, verification complete
- **Documentation needed:**
  - Closure report
  - Management approval
  - Lessons learned
  - System updates implemented

### CAPA Categories in SMETA

**By Pillar:**
- Labour Standards CAPAs
- Health & Safety CAPAs
- Business Ethics CAPAs
- Environmental CAPAs

**By Severity:**
- **Critical:** Immediate risk to life, severe legal violation (e.g., child labor found)
- **Major:** Significant non-compliance, high risk (e.g., missing emergency exits)
- **Minor:** Partial compliance, moderate risk (e.g., incomplete training records)
- **Observation:** Opportunity for improvement (e.g., update policy language)

### What Sedex Auditors Look For in CAPA

✅ **Evidence of Closure:**
- "Show me the CAPA from your last audit in 2023"
- "What did you do about the fire drill finding?"
- "Do you have proof you fixed the wage calculation issue?"

✅ **Timeliness:**
- Critical: 0-30 days
- Major: 30-90 days
- Minor: 90-180 days
- Were deadlines met?

✅ **Root Cause Depth:**
- Superficial: "Training was inadequate" ❌
- Deeper: "Training curriculum lacked hands-on practice component, and supervisors weren't evaluated on safety coaching" ✅

✅ **Preventive Mindset:**
- Reactive: "Repaired broken machine guard" (corrective only)
- Proactive: "Repaired guard + implemented monthly guard inspection program + trained maintenance team on ANSI standards" (corrective + preventive) ✅

✅ **System Integration:**
- "Did you update your procedures to prevent this issue?"
- "Is this now part of your routine monitoring?"

### CAPA Best Practices for "Wowing" Auditor

1. **CAPA Dashboard on Platform Home Screen**
   - Total Open vs. Closed
   - Overdue CAPAs (red flag if any!)
   - Closure rate trend

2. **Color Coding**
   - Red: Critical/Overdue
   - Orange: Major
   - Yellow: Minor
   - Green: Closed

3. **One-Click to Evidence**
   - Auditor clicks CAPA → Sees entire folder with all documentation
   - No searching, no "let me find that"

4. **Before/After Evidence**
   - Photos showing problem vs. resolution
   - Data showing improvement (e.g., accident rate reduction)

5. **Lessons Learned Section**
   - Shows maturity and learning culture
   - "From this CAPA we learned..." → "We changed our system by..."

### Format Deep Dive

#### PDF - The Gold Standard for Most Documents

**Strengths:**
✅ Universal compatibility (every device can open)
✅ Preserves formatting exactly (critical for forms with signatures)
✅ Difficult to alter without leaving traces (authenticity)
✅ Can embed images, photos, scans natively
✅ Searchable (if text-based, not scanned images)
✅ Professional appearance
✅ Can be digitally signed

**Weaknesses:**
❌ Not easily editable (but that's often a feature, not a bug)
❌ Scanned PDFs are large file sizes
❌ Can't sort/filter data within document

**Best Uses:**
- All policies and procedures
- Completed forms with signatures
- Certificates and permits
- Signed meeting minutes
- Photo evidence compilations
- Audit reports

**Pro Tip:** Use PDF bookmarks for long documents (e.g., policy manual with sections)

#### DOCX - The Editable Middle Ground

**Strengths:**
✅ Editable (useful for living documents)
✅ Familiar interface for most users
✅ Track changes feature shows document evolution
✅ Comments and collaboration features
✅ Templates with form fields

**Weaknesses:**
❌ Formatting can break across different Word versions
❌ Auditors may question authenticity (too easy to edit)
❌ Requires Microsoft Office or compatible software
❌ Not ideal for records that should be immutable

**Best Uses:**
- Blank form templates (if showing flexibility)
- Draft procedures (before finalizing to PDF)
- Work-in-progress CAPA action plans

**⚠️ Caution for Audits:**
- Auditors prefer PDFs for official records
- DOCX suggests "this could have been edited recently"
- Use sparingly - convert to PDF once finalized

**Recommendation:** Minimize DOCX in audit presentation; use PDF instead

#### XLSX - The Analytical Powerhouse

**Strengths:**
✅ Perfect for registers, logs, matrices
✅ Sortable and filterable (auditors love this)
✅ Formulas and calculations (e.g., auto-sum hours, average rates)
✅ Multiple tabs (e.g., one file with 12 months of data)
✅ Conditional formatting (highlight overdue items)
✅ Pivot tables for analysis
✅ Export to PDF if needed

**Weaknesses:**
❌ Can be edited easily (version control critical)
❌ Requires Excel or compatible software (Google Sheets, LibreOffice)
❌ Complex spreadsheets may display differently on different systems
❌ Not suitable for narrative documents

**Best Uses:**
- Training Matrix (All employees × All training topics, with dates)
- Attendance Records (If not using specialized time system)
- Incident/Accident Register (Sortable by date, type, severity)
- Grievance Log (Track status, resolution time)
- Chemical Inventory (Quantities, locations, SDS tracking)
- CAPA Register (Master tracking document)
- Supplier Assessment Tracker
- Permit Renewal Tracker
- PPE Distribution Records
- Audit Findings Summary

**Excel Best Practices for Audits:**

1. **Use Tables** (Insert → Table) for auto-filtering
2. **Freeze Top Row** so headers stay visible when scrolling
3. **Date Format Consistency** (use ISO 8601: YYYY-MM-DD for sorting)
4. **No Blank Rows** in data ranges
5. **Data Validation** to prevent input errors
6. **Conditional Formatting** (e.g., red for overdue, green for complete)
7. **Protect Sheets** (optional) to prevent accidental edits during audit
8. **Version Control** in filename (e.g., Training-Matrix-2025-01.xlsx)

### Critical Excel Files Auditors Will Want to See

| File | Tabs | Why Auditors Love It |
|------|------|---------------------|
| **Training Matrix** | All Employees, Training Definitions, Overdue Report | Quickly see who needs training |
| **CAPA Register** | Open CAPAs, Closed CAPAs, Dashboard | Track compliance follow-through |
| **Incident Register** | All Incidents, Summary Stats, TRIR Calculation | Identify safety trends |
| **Attendance Summary** | Monthly Totals, Overtime Hours, Violations | Check working hours compliance |
| **Grievance Log** | Open, Closed, Anonymous Cases | Verify worker voice mechanisms |

### Multi-Format Strategy for Complex Evidence

**Example: Fire Drill Documentation**

```
Fire-Drills/
├── Fire-Drill-Schedule-2025.xlsx         ← Plan (Excel)
├── Fire-Drill-Procedure.pdf              ← How-to (PDF)
├── 2025-01-15-Fire-Drill/
│   ├── Drill-Report-Form.pdf             ← Completed form (PDF)
│   ├── Attendance-Sheet.pdf              ← Signed sheet (PDF)
│   ├── Photos-and-Video-Evidence.pdf     ← Visual proof (PDF)
│   └── Evacuation-Time-Analysis.xlsx     ← Timing data (Excel)
└── 2024-Fire-Drill-Register.xlsx         ← Annual summary (Excel)
```

**Why This Works:**
- **Excel** for schedule and analysis (filterable, trackable)
- **PDF** for immutable records (forms, photos, signatures)
- **Folder structure** groups related evidence
- **Auditor can:** See schedule → Pick a drill → Review complete package

### File Naming Convention Standards

**Critical for Professionalism:**

```
[Pillar]-[Category]-[DocumentType]-[Date/Version].[ext]

Examples:
✅ P1-Policies-Forced-Labour-Policy-v2.0.pdf
✅ P2-Forms-Fire-Drill-Report-2025-01-15.pdf
✅ P2-Evidence-Fire-Drill-Photos-2025-01-15.pdf
✅ P4-Procedures-Waste-Segregation-Procedure-v1.2.pdf
✅ CAPA-Register-2025.xlsx
✅ Training-Matrix-All-Staff-2025-01.xlsx
```

**Naming Rules:**
- No spaces (use hyphens)
- Include date if time-sensitive (ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- Version numbers for controlled documents (v1.0, v2.1)
- Pillar prefix for easy categorization
- Descriptive but concise

## Key Insights & Strategic Recommendations

### Platform Design Priorities

1. **Speed trumps features** - Sub-10-second document retrieval is the killer feature
2. **Excel is critical** - Training matrices, CAPA registers, and incident logs must be in Excel with full functionality
3. **PDF is the workhorse** - 80% of documents should be PDF for authenticity and professionalism
4. **Visual evidence matters** - Photos and videos build credibility more than text
5. **CAPA section is make-or-break** - Demonstrates compliance maturity more than any other section
6. **Authenticity > Perfection** - Don't over-polish; auditors are skeptical of "too perfect"

### Technical Implementation Recommendations

**File Viewer Requirements:**

| Format | Viewer Component | Priority |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| **PDF** | Embed pdf.js viewer in app | CRITICAL - Must support search, zoom, bookmarks |
| **XLSX** | Preview with SheetJS, "Open in Excel" button | HIGH - In-app preview + native Excel for full features |
| **DOCX** | Preview with Mammoth.js, "Open in Word" button | MEDIUM - Preview sufficient, native for editing |
| **Images** | Native image viewer | MEDIUM - Zoom, rotate capabilities |

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **PDF:** Full embedded viewer (pdf.js) - this is the primary format
2. **Excel:** Show preview (first 100 rows) in-app, button to "Open in Excel" for filtering/sorting
3. **Word:** Show preview (rendered as HTML), button to "Open in Word"
4. **Images:** Native viewer with zoom/rotate
